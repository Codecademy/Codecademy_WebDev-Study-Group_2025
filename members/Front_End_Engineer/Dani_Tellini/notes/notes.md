# üìö Dani's Study Notes

Hi! While I do take notes, I much prefer my [Notion](https://www.notion.so) setup! So, rather than duplicating notes here, I'll still manage all of my study notes and resources there, but because I also want to show my process and share my notes with the class I'll be providing a link to my database.

## üìù How I Take Notes

My note-taking approach on Notion involves:

- **Unit/Chapter Organization**: Notes are grouped by Unit and Chapter to make it easy to find.
- **Project Integration**: Any projects I complete off-platform will still be done in this repo, but my notes (if any) will be here as well. I usually try to keep track of the areas I had more difficulty with, and try (key word here really is 'try') to list any resources I used for future reference.
- **Resources & Reference Links**: Links to useful documentation, tutorials, and extra reading. (Again, I _try_ to keep these things updated, but sometimes......)
- **Review Sections**: I put review sections at the end of all of my notes.
- **AI-Integration**: I will be using AI to create checkpoints/reviews/summaries periodically so that I don't always have to go back and review ALL of the notes I took, but focus on key points.

I currently only have notes for Computer Science, as I was taking notes in a notebook before deciding to switch for ease of use. I have not gotten all of my notes in from the Front-End path as of yet.
