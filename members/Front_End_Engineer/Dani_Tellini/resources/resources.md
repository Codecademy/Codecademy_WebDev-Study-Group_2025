# 📂 Dani's Learning Resources

Welcome! This folder contains links and explanations for how I organize the resources that support my learning across various Codecademy Career Paths and beyond.

They will be manually added to the `resources/` folder as well, and while it may seem redundant to keep up both places, it's faster for me to save something in my Notion to add to this repository in bulk at a more convenient time. It also saves on pull requests!

## 📌 How I Organize Resources

I will be using Notion to keep a structured and comprehensive library of:

- **Documentation Links**: Official documentation from MDN, W3Schools, React Docs, etc.
- **Tutorial Collections**: Curated tutorials from Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, YouTube, and more.
- **Articles & Blogs**: Insightful articles, blogs, and industry insights related to web development, accessibility, and coding best practices.
- **Tools & Software**: Lists and comparisons of useful tools and software.
- **Community Resources**: Links to helpful forums, communities, and platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions, and Codecademy forums.

## 🔗 Accessing My Resource Database

You can view and explore all my organized resources as they are added directly in my Notion database:
