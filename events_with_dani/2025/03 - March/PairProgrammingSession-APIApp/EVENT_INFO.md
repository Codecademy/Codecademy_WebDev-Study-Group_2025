# Pair Programming Session â€“ You Choose the Challenge

## ðŸ“¢ Event Overview

On March 28, 2025, we hosted a **Pair Programming Session**, where participants teamed up to collaboratively tackle a project of their choice. This interactive session was designed to encourage live coding, idea sharing, and real-time debugging. Attendees voted on the challenge ahead of timeâ€”and the winning project was an **API-powered app**!

## ðŸ“Œ Session Highlights

- **Challenge Reveal & Teaming Up**:
  - We kicked off the event by announcing the winning poll option: **Fetch & Display Data from an API**.
  - Participants paired up or joined small groups to begin coding together.

- **Live Coding & Collaboration**:
  - Each group built a basic app that used the `fetch()` method to pull live user data from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API.
  - Coders practiced working with asynchronous JavaScript, parsing JSON, and dynamically updating the DOM.

- **Pair Programming Techniques**:
  - Many tried the **Driver/Navigator** role system.
  - Attendees shared insights, spotted bugs, and supported each other in real time.
