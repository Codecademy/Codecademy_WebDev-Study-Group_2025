# Live JavaScript Coding – Build a Simple Calculator! 🔢💻 (April Edition)

## 📢 Event Recap

Thanks for joining us for the **April edition** of our **Live JavaScript Coding Session**! This time, we completed the full build **including all bonus features**, and we’re excited to share that we also recorded the session for those who couldn’t attend live.

Together, we created a fully functional calculator from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while covering beginner-friendly concepts and fun challenges for more advanced learners.

## 🛠️ What We Built

This time, we went beyond the basics:

- A clean and responsive UI styled with CSS
- Clickable number and operator buttons
- JavaScript-driven logic for real-time calculation
- A clear (`C`) button and a backspace (`⌫`) button
- Full keyboard support (type numbers, press Enter, Backspace, and Escape)
- Error handling (division by 0, consecutive operators, multiple decimals)
- Visual feedback animations on button clicks

## 📂 Folder Contents (`/LiveJavaScriptCoding-April/`)

This folder includes:

### `calculator.html`

A single-file version of the final calculator, including all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with bonus features.
