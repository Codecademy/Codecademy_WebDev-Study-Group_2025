# 🐞 Debugging Marathon — Bug Squash Challenge Recap

## 📢 Event Recap

Thanks to everyone who joined us for the **Debugging Marathon** — a one-hour bug-squashing challenge focused on real-world debugging skills in **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**!

This high-energy session challenged participants to track down and fix bugs across three different code sets. Whether it was a console error, a misbehaving layout, or a missing tag, everyone got the chance to flex their DevTools skills, collaborate with peers, and push their problem-solving abilities.

## 🧠 Challenge Structure

Participants received three sets of buggy files located in the `/bug_sets/` directory, each containing common front-end issues to investigate and resolve:

- 🗂️ `set1/` — DOM event and CSS syntax issues  
- 🗂️ `set2/` — logic bugs and missing CSS details  
- 🗂️ `set3/` — a mix of positioning errors, JS typos, and a malformed HTML tag

After working through the sets, participants submitted their fixes via pull request in the `/submissions` folder, using the provided PR comment template to summarize what they corrected.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events, string methods)
- CSS (selectors, layout, visual styling, transitions)
- HTML (semantic structure, script linking)
- DevTools (console logging, element inspection, debugging workflows)

## 📂 Folder Contents

This directory contains:

- 📁 `/bug_sets/` — Three sets of broken files to debug:
  - `/set1/`  
  - `/set2/`  
  - `/set3/`
