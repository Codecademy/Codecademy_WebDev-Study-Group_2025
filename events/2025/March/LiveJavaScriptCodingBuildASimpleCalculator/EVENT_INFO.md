# Live JavaScript Coding - Build a Simple Calculator! 🔢💻

## 📢 Event Summary

Thank you to everyone who joined the **Live JavaScript Coding Session**! In this interactive event, we built a fully functional calculator using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, step by step. It was a fun and productive session for beginners and intermediate learners alike.

Although there is **no recording available**, you'll find everything you need to revisit the session or finish your own version below.

## 🛠️ What We Built

A fully working calculator that includes:

- A clean user interface styled with CSS
- Clickable buttons for digits and operations
- JavaScript functions to evaluate user input
- A clear and a backspace button
- Extra error handling for dividing by 0 and multiple decimals and operators

## 📂 Folder Contents (`/LiveJavaScriptCodingBuildASimpleCalculator/`)

This folder includes:

### `calculator.html`

A complete single-file HTML calculator with all code (HTML, CSS, JS) embedded. This is the final version built during the event.

## 🧠 Suggestions for Next Steps

Here are some things you could add to the orignial code. Submit your final code to the `/submissions/` folder!

- Add percentages
- Add keyboard support
- Add more error handling (We noticed that once 'Error' shows on the display you can still add operators and the decimal...oops!)
- Add memory buttons (M+, M-, MR)
- Style the calculator with themes or animations
- Build a scientific calculator or unit converter
