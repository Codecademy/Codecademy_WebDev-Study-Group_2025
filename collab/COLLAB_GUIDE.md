# Collaboration Projects

Welcome to the **Collaboration Projects** folder for the Codecademy Web Dev Study Groups 2025! This space is dedicated to group projects and collaborative learning. Here, you can find exciting projects to join or start your own and work with fellow study group members to enhance your front-end development skills.

## How to Collaborate

### 1. Finding a Project

- Browse the `/collab` folder for ongoing projects.
  - Each project will have its own subfolder, named descriptively (e.g., `/collab/project_name`), containing a `README.md` with project details.
- Read through the project descriptions to find one that matches your interests and skill level.

### 2. Finding Collaborators

- Check the `README.md` file of a project for contact information and open roles.
- Use [our Front-End](https://community.codecademy.com/c/front-end-engineer-journey-study-group/) or [our Full-Stack](https://community.codecademy.com/c/full-stack-engineer-journey-study-group/) study groups in our Circle community to reach out to others. You will only be able to access the study group you're in!
- If you have an idea for a project, create a new subfolder and write a clear `README.md` explaining your idea and what help youâ€™re looking for, along with your Circle profile link, or other means of communication.

### 3. Starting a Project

- Create a new subfolder under `/collab` with a descriptive name.
- Add a `README.md` to your folder with the following information:
  - Project title and description.
  - Goals and technologies used.
  - Open roles or tasks for collaborators.
  - Contact information for interested members.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Codecademy_WebDev-Study-Group_2025.git
  ```

### 2. Create a Branch

- Navigate to the `/collab` folder and the subfolder for the project youâ€™re contributing to.
- Create a new branch for your contributions:
  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 3. Make Changes

- Work on the tasks or features assigned to you.
- Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages:
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes"
  ```

### 4. Push Changes

- Push your branch to your forked repository:
  
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

- Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
- Click "Compare & pull request" for your branch.
- Write a detailed description of the changes youâ€™ve made, including the task or feature completed.
- Request a review from the project owner or collaborators.

## Guidelines for Successful Collaboration

- **Communicate**: Stay in touch with your team, share updates, and ask for help if needed.
- **Respect**: Be respectful of different skill levels and ideas.
- **Document**: Keep the project folder organized and update the `README.md` regularly.
